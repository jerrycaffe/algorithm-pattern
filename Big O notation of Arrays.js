// Big O noation of Array
// arrays can be used when order is needed unlike object that is used when order is not needed




// Inserting depends  - using unshift is 0(N) since reindexing is involved while push is 0(1) since reindexing is not involved
// Removal -  using shift is 0(N) since reindexing is involved while pop is 0(1) since reindexing is not involved
// Searching has 0(N) - this depends on the position of the thing being searched
// Access 0(1) since one can call on any index to give what one is looking for


// Big 0 of Array Operations
// -push - 0(1)
// -pop - 0(1)
// -shift - 0(N)
// -unshift - 0(N)
// -concat - 0(N)
// -slice - 0(N)
// -splice - 0(N)
// -sort - 0(N * log N)
// forEach/map/filter/reduce/etc - 0(N)


// Differences between object and Array
// 1. Objects are faster but it has no order for stored elements
// 2.
